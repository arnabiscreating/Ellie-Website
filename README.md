# :dart: Ellie Website
This Website is a part of a project called Ellie - Your friend in need.  
Since this project is for **well being of mental health (Anti Depression)** so i tried to add minimum possible saturated colours and made the website very eye soothing. Illustrations and fonts are subtle and i avoided condensed words so the end user doesn't get irritated and foggy by looking at it.  
I tried to give the website a very clean look and added some **urban / modern flavour** to it.
